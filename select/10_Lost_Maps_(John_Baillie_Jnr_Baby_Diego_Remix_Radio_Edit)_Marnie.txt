I see no empathy, bitter warnings, and lies
We are just ordinary people
Get on your knees and pray
I say

Whatcha gonna do, where are you gonna go
When the darkness closes on you
Is there anybody out there looking for you?
Do they know what you've been through?

Gotta find the time, search the silence,
Open up your mind, survival's not a crime
Is there anybody out there speaking the truth
Don't believe what they tell you

A sigh epidemic terrorizing our lives
No more accomplice geography, we are lost maps to take
I say

Whatcha gonna do, where are you gonna go
When the darkness closes on you
Is there anybody out there looking for you?
Do they know what you've been through?

Gotta find the time, search the silence,
Open up your mind, survival's not a crime
Is there anybody out there speaking the truth
Don't believe what they tell you

Whatcha gonna do, where are you gonna go
When the darkness closes on you
Is there anybody out there looking for you?
Do they know what you've been through?

Gotta find the time, search the silence,
Open up your mind, survival's not a crime
Is there anybody out there speaking the truth
Don't believe what they tell you
